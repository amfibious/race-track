# race-track

This is a desktop application written in C# using the Windows Forms desktop framework.
It involves a race track simulation of the dog racing game porpular among those that partronize virtual betting businesses.
It was the first application I created using C# in early 2017 hence it might not adhere to best practices.
It's here for beginners to learn from and build on.
